<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>Systems development is the process of defining, designing, testing, and implementing a new software application or
program. It could include the internal development of customized systems, the creation of database systems, or the
acquisition of third party developed software. Written standards and procedures must guide all information systems
processing functions. The organization’s management must define and implement standards and adopt an appropriate
system development life cycle methodology governing the process of developing, acquiring, implementing, and
maintaining computerized information systems and related technology.

<h2>Examination Objectives:</h2>
Determine if the board and management have established and maintained effective systems development methodology.
This is accomplished through the following examination objectives:<br>
• Board and Management Oversight – Assess the adequacy of systems development oversight by examining
related policies, procedures, and methodology.<br>
• Risk Assessment—Determine the level of systems development activities existing within the institution. If
systems development activities for mission-critical systems are handled primarily through a service provider,
evaluate management’s due diligence to ensure appropriate documentation and controls exist within the service
provider’s development processes. Assess the adequacy of the institution’s risk assessment process for
systems development.<br>
• Internal Controls—Evaluate the effectiveness of preventive and detective controls designed to identify material
deficiencies on a timely basis. The internal audit function should identify systems development as an area for
evaluation and review.

<h2>Examination Procedures:</h2>
Examination activities should be based on the criticality and complexity of the business functions present at the
institution. The examination should begin with a review of internal and external audit activities and risk assessments for
systems development.<br> At a minimum, the Essential Practices for Systems Development should be clearly
documented and functioning within the internal control environment. </p>
